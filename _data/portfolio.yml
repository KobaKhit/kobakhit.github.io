- title: Effect of minimum wage increase on food industry in PA
  cat: repres
  description: "The purpose of this research paper was to either confirm or reject the hypothesis that the increase in minumum wage affected employment in the food industry in PA. I used OLS regression and the R framework. The data was obtained from the US Burea of Labor statistics. Increase in the minimum wage did decrease employment by 1.33% which was equivalent to six thousand people. The result was statistically reasonable."
